I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills, contributing to projects that have a positive impact.  
Besides programming, I enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating with other developers, whether in open-source projects or private initiatives.  

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about development, enjoying a good movie, studying music, or cooking. :)
